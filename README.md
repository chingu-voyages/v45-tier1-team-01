# ‚òÑÔ∏è MeteorHub

## Overview

This app was created for Chingu Voyage 45. It uses data from the
[NASA Meteor Landing API](https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gh4g-9sfh.json) and presents it in an engaging and user-friendly manner, making it both informative and enjoyable!!

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
5. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

## üìí Features

**Note**: Instead of fetching the data from [NASA Meteor landing API](https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gh4g-9sfh.json), we created a file `data.js` in `src/assets/data.js` which contains all the fetched data. Since, at the time of making this project the data pulled from the API is static and not changing.

- The search field lets the user search data based on user input for the following criteria:
  - Name
  - Year of strike
  - Meteorite composition (`recclass`)
  
- The filter button lets the user filter data based on user input of Mass range (e.g. low to high, inclusive)

- Clicking on the `x` button inside the search bar will clear the input field as well as update the DOM to show all the meteor landings.

- The data is displayed in the form of a scrollable table. Each row shows data about a particular meteor landing. When a specific meteor landing is clicked it brings up a pop-up containing more details about the meteor landing.

- All the data is summarized in the Summary Metric. Summary Metric displays the following metrics for the data that has been selected:

  - Total number of strikes
  - Average mass
  - Histogram showing the number of strikes by year
  - Histogram showing the number of strikes by meteorite composition (`recclass`).

( **If no search criteria have been selected then the summary metrics will be for all meteorite strikes.** )
